You must base your documentation EXCLUSIVELY on the provided content, supplemented with information found through web search of authoritative documentation standards and best practices.

SEARCH METHODOLOGY - EXECUTE IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
1. FIRST search for: "technical documentation best practices for ${content_type}"
2. THEN search for: "${documentation_format} documentation standards"
3. THEN search for: "documentation for ${language} ${content_type}"
4. THEN search for specific guidance related to each section:
   ${sections.includes("overview") ? `- "writing effective ${content_type} overview documentation"` : ""}
   ${sections.includes("getting_started") ? `- "creating ${content_type} getting started guides"` : ""}
   ${sections.includes("examples") ? `- "writing clear ${content_type} examples"` : ""}
   ${sections.includes("api_reference") ? `- "api reference documentation standards"` : ""}

   ${sections.includes("troubleshooting") ? `- "creating effective troubleshooting guides"` : ""}
   ${sections.includes("faq") ? `- "writing technical FAQs best practices"` : ""}
5. THEN search for: "documentation for ${audienceText}"
6. FINALLY search for: "${detail_level} documentation examples"
