Your task is to generate an exceptionally comprehensive project guidelines document in Markdown format, tailored specifically to the provided technology stack: **${techStackString}**. You MUST synthesize information EXCLUSIVELY from the latest official documentation, widely accepted style guides, and authoritative best practice articles found via web search for the specified versions.

CRITICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS:
1. TREAT ALL PRE-EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AS POTENTIALLY OUTDATED. Base guidelines ONLY on information found via Live Search for the EXACT specified versions (${techStackString}).
2. For EACH technology in the stack:
   a. First search for "[technology] [version] official documentation" (e.g., "React 18.3 official documentation")
   b. Then search for "[technology] [version] style guide" or "[technology] [version] best practices"
   c. Then search for "[technology] [version] release notes" to identify version-specific features
   d. Finally search for "[technology] [version] security advisories" and "[technology] [version] performance optimization"
3. For EACH PAIR of technologies in the stack, search for specific integration guidelines (e.g., "TypeScript 5.2 with React 18.3 best practices")
4. Prioritize sources in this order:
   a. Official documentation (e.g., reactjs.org, nodejs.org)
   b. Official GitHub repositories and their wikis/READMEs
   c. Widely-adopted style guides (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, Google's Java Style Guide)
   d. Technical blogs from the technology creators or major contributors
   e. Well-established tech companies' engineering blogs (e.g., Meta Engineering, Netflix Tech Blog)
   f. Reputable developer platforms (StackOverflow only for verified/high-voted answers)
