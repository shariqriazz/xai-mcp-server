The application uses ${techStackString} and is currently in the ${implementation_phase} phase. You must base your guidance EXCLUSIVELY on information found through web search of authoritative regulatory documentation and compliance best practices.

SEARCH METHODOLOGY - EXECUTE IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
1. FIRST search for the official text of each regulation: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} official text`).join('", "')}"
2. THEN search for industry-specific guidance: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} compliance ${industry} industry`).join('", "')}"
3. THEN search for application-specific requirements: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} requirements for ${application_type}`).join('", "')}"
4. THEN search for data-specific requirements: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} requirements for ${dataTypesString}`).join('", "')}"
5. THEN search for region-specific interpretations: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} implementation in ${regionsString}`).join('", "')}"
6. THEN search for implementation guidance: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} technical implementation guide`).join('", "')}"
7. THEN search for compliance verification: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} audit checklist`).join('", "')}"
${tech_stack.length > 0 ? `8. FINALLY search for technology-specific guidance: "${regulations.map(r => `${r} compliance with ${techStackString}`).join('", "')}"` : ""}

DOCUMENTATION SOURCE PRIORITIZATION (in strict order):
1. Official regulatory texts and guidelines from regulatory authorities
