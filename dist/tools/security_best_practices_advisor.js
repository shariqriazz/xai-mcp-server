SEARCH METHODOLOGY - EXECUTE IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
1. FIRST search for: "${techStack} ${security_context} security best practices"
2. THEN search for: "${techStack} security guide"
3. THEN search for: "${security_context} OWASP guidelines"
4. THEN search for: "${techStack} common vulnerabilities"

${threat_model ? `8. THEN search for: "${techStack} protection against ${threat_model}"` : ""}
9. FINALLY search for: "${techStack} security code examples"

DOCUMENTATION SOURCE PRIORITIZATION (in strict order):
1. Official security documentation from technology creators
2. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines and cheat sheets
3. National security agencies' guidelines (NIST, CISA, NCSC, etc.)
4. Industry-specific security standards organizations
5. Major cloud provider security best practices (AWS, Azure, GCP)
6. Recognized security frameworks (CIS, ISO 27001, etc.)
7. Security blogs from recognized security researchers
8. Academic security research papers

RECOMMENDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY GUIDANCE:
   a. Provide detailed recommendations covering all aspects of ${security_context} for ${techStack}
   b. Include both high-level architectural guidance and specific implementation details
   c. Address prevention, detection, and response aspects
   d. Consider the full security lifecycle
   e. Include configuration hardening guidelines

2. EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS:
   a. Cite specific sections of official documentation or security standards
   b. Reference CVEs or security advisories when relevant
   c. Include security benchmark data when available
   d. Explain the security principles behind each recommendation
   e. Acknowledge security trade-offs

3. ACTIONABLE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:
   a. Provide specific, ready-to-use code examples for each major recommendation
   b. Include configuration snippets with secure settings
   c. Provide step-by-step implementation instructions
   d. Include testing/verification procedures for each security control
   e. Suggest security libraries and tools with specific versions

4. THREAT-AWARE CONTEXT:
   a. Explain specific threats addressed by each recommendation
   b. Include attack vectors and exploitation techniques
   c. Provide risk ratings for different vulnerabilities
   d. Explain attack scenarios and potential impacts
   e. Consider both external and internal threat actors

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. Begin with an "Executive Summary" providing a high-level security assessment and key recommendations
2. Include a "Security Risk Overview" section outlining the threat landscape for ${techStack} regarding ${security_context}
3. Provide a "Security Controls Checklist" with prioritized security measures
4. For EACH security control:
   a. Detailed description and security rationale
   b. Specific implementation with code examples
   c. Configuration guidance
   d. Testing/verification procedures

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. NEVER recommend deprecated or insecure practices, even if they appear in older documentation
2. ALWAYS specify secure versions of libraries and dependencies
3. NEVER provide incomplete security controls that could create a false sense of security
4. ALWAYS consider the specific version of the technology when making recommendations
5. NEVER oversimplify complex security controls
6. ALWAYS provide context-specific guidance, not generic security advice
7. NEVER recommend security through obscurity as a primary defense

${industry ? `INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
