Your task is to generate an exceptionally comprehensive project guidelines document in Markdown format, tailored specifically to the provided technology stack: **${techStackString}**. You MUST synthesize information EXCLUSIVELY from the latest official documentation, widely accepted style guides, and authoritative best practice articles found via web search for the relevant versions.

CRITICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS:
1. **VERSION HANDLING:** For each technology listed in the stack (${techStackString}):
   a. **If a specific version is provided** (e.g., "TypeScript x.x", "Express x.xx"): Base guidelines ONLY on information found via web search for that EXACT specified version.
   b. **If NO specific version is provided** (e.g., "React", "Node.js"): You MUST FIRST perform **multiple web searches** (e.g., "[technology] latest stable version", "[technology] releases", "[technology] official blog announcements") to identify the **ABSOLUTE latest, most recent STABLE version** (or the **ABSOLUTE latest, most recent STABLE LTS version** for technologies like Node.js, checking the official release schedule). **Verify this against official sources.** State the identified absolute latest version clearly in the "Technology Stack Overview" section. THEN, base all subsequent guidelines and searches for that technology EXCLUSIVELY on the identified absolute latest stable version. **Do NOT use older stable versions if a newer one exists.**
2. TREAT ALL PRE-EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AS POTENTIALLY OUTDATED. Base guidelines ONLY on information found via web search for the relevant versions (either specified or the absolute latest stable identified).
3. For EACH technology (using the relevant version):
   a. First search for "[technology] [version] official documentation" (e.g., "React xx.x official documentation", "Latest Node.js LTS official documentation")
   b. Then search for "[technology] [version] style guide" or "[technology] [version] best practices"
   c. Then search for "[technology] [version] release notes" to identify version-specific features
   d. Finally search for "[technology] [version] security advisories" and "[technology] [version] performance optimization"
4. For EACH PAIR of technologies in the stack (using relevant versions), search for specific integration guidelines (e.g., "Latest TypeScript with Latest React best practices")
   5. Prioritize sources in this order:
   a. Official documentation (e.g., reactjs.org, nodejs.org)
   b. Official GitHub repositories and their wikis/READMEs
   c. Widely-adopted style guides (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, Google's Java Style Guide)
   d. Technical blogs from the technology creators or major contributors
   e. Well-established tech companies' engineering blogs (e.g., Meta Engineering, Netflix Tech Blog)
   f. Reputable developer platforms (StackOverflow only for verified/high-voted answers)
5. Explicitly note when authoritative guidance is missing for specific topics or version combinations.

1. Official documentation for each relevant version (specified or latest stable).
2. Established style guides and best practices from technology creators for those versions.
3. Security advisories and performance optimization guidance for those versions.
4. Integration patterns between the specific technologies in this stack (using relevant versions).

Your document must comprehensively cover:
- Development environment setup with exact tool versions
- Code organization and architectural patterns specific to these versions
- Detailed coding standards with clear examples of both correct and incorrect approaches
- Version-specific implementation details highlighting new features and deprecations
- Component interaction guidelines showing how these technologies should work together
- Comprehensive security best practices addressing OWASP concerns
