SEARCH METHODOLOGY - EXECUTE IN THIS EXACT ORDER:
1. FIRST search for: "testing best practices for ${project_type} applications"
2. THEN search for: "testing frameworks for ${techStackString}"
3. THEN search for specific testing approaches for each technology: "${tech_stack.map(t => `${t} testing best practices`).join('", "')}"
4. THEN search for testing approaches for each priority: "${priorities.map((p) => `${project_type} ${p} testing`).join('", "')}"
5. THEN search for: "${project_type} test automation with ${techStackString}"
6. THEN search for: "test coverage metrics for ${project_type} applications"

   e. Create a phased testing approach with clear milestones

2. MULTI-LEVEL TESTING APPROACH:
   a. Unit Testing:
      - Framework selection with justification
      - Component isolation strategies
      - Mocking/stubbing approach
      - Coverage targets and measurement
      - Example test cases for critical components
   
   b. Integration Testing:
      - Integration points identification
      - Testing approach (top-down, bottom-up, sandwich)
      - Service/API contract testing strategy
      - Data consistency verification
      - Example integration test scenarios

      - Cross-browser/device strategy (if applicable)
      - Test data management approach
      - Example E2E test scenarios

      - Performance metrics and baselines
      - Performance testing tools and configuration
      - Performance test scenarios` : ""}

   e. Continuous improvement mechanisms

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. Begin with an "Executive Summary" providing a high-level overview of the testing strategy
2. Include a "Testing Objectives and Scope" section defining clear goals
3. Provide a "Test Approach" section detailing the overall methodology
4. For EACH testing level (unit, integration, E2E, specialized):
   a. Detailed approach and methodology
   b. Tool and framework recommendations with versions
   c. Example test cases or scenarios
   d. Coverage targets and measurement approach
   e. Implementation guidelines
5. Include a "Test Automation Strategy" section
6. Provide a "Testing Infrastructure" section
7. Include a "Test Management and Reporting" section
8. Conclude with an "Implementation Roadmap" with phased approach

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. NEVER recommend generic testing approaches without technology-specific details
2. ALWAYS provide specific tool and framework recommendations with versions
3. NEVER overlook critical testing areas based on the project type
4. ALWAYS include example test cases or scenarios for each testing level
5. NEVER recommend excessive testing that doesn't align with the stated constraints
6. ALWAYS prioritize testing efforts based on risk and impact
7. NEVER recommend tools or frameworks that are incompatible with the tech stack
